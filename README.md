# Stock Price Forecaster
 
The effectiveness of using a linear regression model to forecast stock market values is examined in this project. 
It deals with the difficulties that traders face as a result of the volatility of the market, which is influenced by numerous uncontrollable factors. 
I use the yfinance library, this Yahoo Finance library uses real time data of the prices of the stock market. 
This library helps with the creation of a predictive model that was intended to help with stock market prediction. 
The model helps users determine the best times to buy and sell by offering upper and lower price bounds for a given amount.



Utilizing the information gathered, a Python file was created and predictions were produced using a linear regression model.
My research shows that the linear regression model can predict stock market trends with an approximate accuracy rate of 80%. 
For analysts and investors looking to make wise choices in the stock market, this offers a useful resource.

In the future, I plan to improve this program by adding more sophisticated artificial intelligence models to further enhance predictive capabilities and by integrating larger volumes of data from different businesses and stock exchanges.
